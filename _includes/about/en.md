Hi, I am Pengfei Zhang, a Phd Student of Computer Science in the Chinese University of Hong Kong. My interests now are at in-memory database, data mining, machine learn. Every week I will read some books, papers and blog, but I always forget almost of the contents that I have read. So I want to do a summary of the knowledge that I learned this week to a blog every week. In this way, not only could I make every clear and improve the capability of writing and 
expressing.
